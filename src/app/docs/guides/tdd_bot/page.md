## Introduction

In this guide, we'll walk through step by step on how to create a bot with the
Sublayer gem that takes your tests, any failures of those tests, and gets an LLM
to write code to pass those tests.

If you'd like to follow along on the guide and with the video you can grab the
code here on the "starting\_point" branch: [TDD Bot](https://github.com/sublayerapp/tddbot/tree/starting_point)

The final code for this guide is available on the "main" branch: [TDD
Bot](https://github.com/sublayerapp/tddbot)
