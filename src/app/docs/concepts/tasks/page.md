### Tasks

Tasks combine Generators and Actions to accomplish a specific goal. They involve a sequence of generation and action steps that may include basic decision-making and flow control. Tasks are the high-level building blocks that define the desired outcome.

#### Examples:

- ModifyFileContentsTask: Generates new file contents based on the existing contents and a set of rules, and then saves the new contents to the file.
