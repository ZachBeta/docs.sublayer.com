Actions are responsible for performing specific operations to get inputs for a Generator or based on the generated output from a Generator. They encapsulate a single action and do not involve complex decision-making. Actions are the executable units that bring the generated inputs to life.

## Examples:

- SaveToFileAction: Saves generated output to a file.
- RunCommandLineCommandAction: Runs a generated command line command.
